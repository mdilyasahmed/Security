Reflected Injection attack can be performed differently according to the HTTP methods i.e, GET and POST. I would remind, that with POST method data is being sent and with GET method data is being requested.
Initially attacker can check the source code for the login form and proceeding towards the method used for then appropriate HTML Injection will be carried out
<div class="test">
  <from id= "test-login" method="post" action= "#">
    <input type= text id= test-username class name= "user"
    placeholder= "Email">
    <input type= "password" id= "test-password" class name="pass"
